## Production ready

Support is not given on Discord, but please expect this resource to _just work_.
Features are not missing, and we are not awaiting feedback and suggestions to further improve functionality.

## Database

Only [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/downloads/) is officially supported.
We guarantee older versions of MySQL will work as expected, and not guarantee MySQL 8 is incompatible.

## Third-party resources

We ask that any resources you create _do use the ox prefix_.
Doing so adds confusion about the resource creator and can lead to multiple resources existing with the name (i.e. ox_banking).

## Sample usage

Refer to [ox_core-example](https://github.com/overextended/ox_core-example) for some sample code. This should give some idea of how to use player and vehicle refs.
